## Setup x509 Hierarchy

1. `./create-role-keys.sh`

Makes all the keys, pem files and csr (certificate signing request) files for each role in hierarchy.

**in real world:**  keys, pem files and csr would be generated by each role on their own setups.

2. `./create-self-signed-cert.sh`

Creates self-signed cert with the certificate authorities key.

**in real world:**  this is done by the head of security on own setup.

3. `./ca-review-and-sign.sh`

Goes through each key of each role, views each and signs if information is correct.
Extra attributes must be left empty.

**in real world:**  this is done by the head of security on own setup, once member in each role sends over the required files.

4. `./check-and-hash-certs.sh`

Go through each certificates and double check we are happy with them.
If we are happy, produce a hash of each.

**in real world:**  this is done by the head of security on own setup, once member in each role sends over the required files.

5. Publish the certs and the keys.

Head of security should then publicly publish;
- The public `xxx-cert.pem` for each role including CA/themselves (and cert hash)
- The public `xxx-.kvey` for each role including CA/themselves (and key hash)
